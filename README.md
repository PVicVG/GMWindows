# Multiple Functions!
GMWindows features three different kinds of Windows you can implement in your project,

## Message Boxes.
GameMaker has a default message box system with show message, however, that should only be used for debugging. If you need something more practical and fancier, this is perfect for you.
> Display messages in a fancy manner.

## String Boxes
With the String Boxes you are able to retrieve Strings from the player. Again, this is similar to the "show message" function, however, much better overall.
> Useful for naming things!
