## Message Boxes.
GameMaker has a default message box system with show message, however, that should only be used for debugging. If you need something more practical and fancier, this is perfect for you.
Display messages in a fancy manner.

## String Boxes
With the String Boxes you are able to retrieve Strings from the player. Again, this is similar to the "show message" function, however, much better overall.
Get strings from the user. Useful for naming things!
